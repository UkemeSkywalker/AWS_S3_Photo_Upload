## Overview

This project provides a solution for uploading photos to Amazon S3 directly from a web browser.

## Features

- Direct Browser Uploads: Allow users to upload photos directly from their web browsers to your Amazon S3 bucket.


- Asynchronous Processing: Handle asynchronous processing of uploaded photos, such as triggering additional processing tasks or generating thumbnails.

- AWS SDK Integration: Utilize the AWS SDK for JavaScript in the browser to simplify interactions with Amazon S3.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. AWS Account: Ensure you have an AWS account set up with the necessary permissions to create and manage S3 buckets, IAM roles, and Lambda functions.

2. AWS CLI: Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) for seamless interaction with AWS services from the command line.

3. AWS SDK for JavaScript: Include the AWS SDK for JavaScript.

4. Web Browser: Ensure your web application supports HTML and JavaScript for client-side photo uploads.

### Steps

1. Create an S3 Bucket:
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Create an S3 bucket to store the uploaded photos.

2. Set Up IAM Role:
   - Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions to allow users to upload photos to your S3 bucket.

3. Generate Pre-Signed URLs:
   - Create a server-side component (e.g., AWS Lambda function or a dedicated server) to generate pre-signed URLs for uploading photos. This ensures secure and temporary access for users.

4. Integrate AWS SDK in Browser:
   - Include the AWS SDK for JavaScript in the project.
   - Use the SDK to request pre-signed URLs and handle the photo upload process.

5. Handle Asynchronous Processing (Optional):
   - Set up an AWS Lambda function to handle asynchronous processing of uploaded photos, such as resizing images or triggering notifications.

6. Implement User Interface:
   - Design and implement a user interface  to allow users to select and upload photos.

7. Test and Debug:
   - Test the photo upload process, ensuring that photos are correctly uploaded to the S3 bucket.
